# Formation 🦕

All the carbon in a fossil fuel was once in something alive.

Hundreds of millions of years ago, the dead remains of plants and microscopic plankton happened to get buried in places where oxygen couldn't easily get to them. Places like the bottoms of swamps in ancient forests, or beneath sediments under the sea.

    Roughly 99 percent of the carbon in organic matter will decay into carbon dioxide. The remaining 1% is the reservoir from which fossil fuels are formed.

Normally when creatures die, they decompose, and the carbon within them quickly returns to the air. But decomposition requires oxygen. In the absence of oxygen, much of that energy-rich carbon remained trapped in these geological burial grounds, lying dormant for hundreds of millions of years.

Over the eras, continents shifted and collided, dinosaurs came and went, plants invented flowers, birds took flight, and tiny mouse-like mammals hesitantly ventured out from the safety of their burrows, eventually growing into the family of animals that includes us.

Meanwhile, beneath the Earth’s surface, all that dormant carbon was being heated and compressed, transforming into some of the most energy rich substances we humans have ever known — coal, oil, and natural gas.

Today we’re unearthing tons of this ancient carbon — about 10 billion tons of it in 2019 alone. In effect, we're burning through a carbon bank account that's been quietly compounding interest for hundreds of millions of years.

By returning all this carbon into the air, we’re transforming the composition of our oceans and atmosphere and, as a consequence, altering the climate of our planet.

      Look up any age above, and you'll find the percentage of all human industrial CO2 emissions that occurred within this lifetime. *Human CO2 emissions* are defined here as the rise in CO2 levels between the pre-industrial value of [280 parts per million](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/weekly.html) and the 2019 average value. This is a variant of a graph originally created by [link text:"Neil Kaye" url:"https://twitter.com/neilrkaye/status/1129347990777413632" /].
    [/caption]

      We tend to think of the climate crisis as a historical problem. But these numbers tell a different story. Just 35 years —  a single generation — contributed the bulk of CO2 emissions. No humans before us have ever witnessed such a steep rise in carbon dioxide.

      To better understand this, let’s take a personalized tour of the history of carbon dioxide — personalized around *you*. We’ll start in 2020, tracing our way backwards through the years of your life.

      But we first need to know how to measure carbon dioxide. The basic unit in which we measure CO2 concentration is *parts per million*, or *ppm* for short.

      A 1 ppm concentration of CO2 means that one out of every million parts of air is carbon dioxide. If we could see the world from the perspective of a molecule, here's what this concetration of carbon dioxide might look like.

      [var name:"vizppm" value:1 /]

            [span className:"pull-number"]1 ppm[/span]
            [span className:"pull-number-text"]
              1 part per million is a miniscule concentration, which is why you barely see any CO2 molecules in the visualization. In this microscopic perspective, a lone CO2 molecule occasionally drifts past you.
            [/span]

        [Conditional if:`vizppm == 10`]
          [span className:"pull-number"]10 ppm[/span]
          [span className:"pull-number-text"]
            At 10 parts per million, you can start to see a handful of CO2 molecules whizzing past. At CO2 levels this low, the Earth would be a frozen, lifeless rock.

        [/Conditional]

        [Conditional if:`vizppm == 100`]
          [span className:"pull-number"]100 ppm[/span]
          [span className:"pull-number-text"]
            At 100 parts per million, we start to see more and more CO2 molecules. Carbon dioxide is Earth's thermostat. As we increase the concentration of CO2 in the air, we're dialing up the greenhouse effect, and warming up the Earth.

        [/Conditional]

        [Conditional if:`vizppm == 280`]
          [span className:"pull-number"]280 ppm[/span]
          [span className:"pull-number-text"]
            280 parts per million was the CO2 level before the Industrial Revolution. Global average temperatures were about 1°C cooler than they are today.

          [span className:"pull-number-text"]
            412 parts per million was the CO2 level in 2019. We're currently at about 1°C of global warming, compared to the pre-industrial era.

          This graph shows us the entire history of industrialization as seen through the lens of CO2. Notice how it's grown steeper with every passing decade.

          During the Industrial Revolution, industrialized nations started to burn coal at a rate never seen before, and so carbon dioxide levels began to increase. But that was just a gentle slope, in comparison to the steep rise in CO2 that we're creating today. 

          Everyone alive today is living through a great acceleration, an unprecedented ramping up of carbon consumption and CO2 output.

          To see this even more clearly, let's go further back in time. What did CO2 levels look like before the Industrial Revolution began?

            We’ve arrived 10,000 years before the present, around the time that hunter-gatherers in the Stone Age were starting to put down their bows and arrows and turn to cultivating plants.

            From this deep historical perspective, we can see that all human civilization from the year 1900 to the dawn of agriculture took place in a relatively flat, stable era of lower CO2 concentrations. From this point of view, it’s clear that we are the first (and likely will be the only) humans to ever live through such a dramatic spike in carbon dioxide.

            That’s worrying, because as we’re about to see, the climate follows CO2. Historically, whenever carbon dioxide levels spiked or fell, global temperatures followed.

            # The Ice Ages ❄️

            Let’s travel further back in our CO2 time machine. But now, in addition to carbon dioxide levels, let’s also overlap the temperature record. This will help us see how carbon dioxide regulates the climate.
